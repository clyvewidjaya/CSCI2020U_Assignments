Type this in Terminal

> git clone https://github.com/clyvewidjaya/CSCI2020U_Assignments.git
> cd CSCI2020U_Assignments
> cd Assignment_1
> ./run

When the directory chooser pops up, choose any directory/folder that contains
both train and test folders. My program will find folders named train and test
inside that chosen directory. So if the test and train folder are in desktop,
just choose desktop and click open.

For improving part, I added more symbols on the string pattern, so the bag of words
will have more to be considered as word. Since sometimes '!!!' could also have
a high spam probability, that is why we need to consider that to be counted as 
word with spam probability.
